# About Morpheus Systems

Morpheus Systems (Morpheus Inc.) is a software development company that focuses on use of AI to analyze conversations. We are based in Berkeley, California. Our initial project is to create a web version of [Loom](https://cyborgism.wiki/hypha/loom) to enable online access to base models and an interface for selecting completion branches. This enables AI analysis of conversations with proper prompting. In the future, we plan to develop more automated forms of AI conversation analysis, which may make use of information such as entropy and vocal tone features. This could enable more advanced forms of conversation analysis, such as detecting deception or emotional states.
